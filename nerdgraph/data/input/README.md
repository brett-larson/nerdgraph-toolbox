# Input Directory

This directory is empty by default. Its purpose is to hold any `CSV`, `JSON`, or other data files that are used as input in this project. 

Be careful when pushing to GitHub. `CSV` files are ignored by default, but `JSON` files are not. If you want to ignore a `JSON` file, add it to the `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the project.
